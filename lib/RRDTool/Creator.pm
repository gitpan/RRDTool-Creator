=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<RRDTool::Creator> objects are specific creators for different kind of RRD files. 
They are based on the Round Robin Database Tool (L<http://www.rrdtool.org>) and on the Perl module L<RRDTool::OO>.

=head1 NOTES

C<RRDTool::Creator> tries to be compatible with both the official RRDTool documentation 
and the C<RRDTool::OO> module. 
It is why some functions and some arguments have two possible names
(in this case, the main name is conform to the official documentation and the auxiliary one is for compatibility with the C<RRDTool::OO> module).

=cut

=head1 COMMON METHODS

=head2 add_DS (auxiliary name: add_data_source)

Add a data source in the RRD specifications.
Its arguments are :

=over 4

=item B<ds_name> (auxiliary name: B<name>)

(I<mandatory>) The name of the data source.

=item B<DST> (auxiliary name: B<type>)

(I<mandatory>) The data source type : C<GAUGE>, C<COUNTER>, C<DERIVE> or C<ABSOLUTE> (see L<http://www.rrdtool.org>).

=item B<heartbeat>

(I<optionnal>) The maximum number of seconds that may pass between two updates of this data source before the value of the data source is assumed to be *UNKNOWN*.
Default is 2*step.

=item B<min>

(I<optionnal>) The expected minimum value for data supplied by a data source. 
Any value outside the defined range will be regarded as *UNKNOWN*. 
Default is "U" for unknown.

=item B<max>

(I<optionnal>) The expected maximum value for data supplied by a data source. 
Any value outside the defined range will be regarded as *UNKNOWN*. 
Default is "U" for unknown.

    $creator->add_DS(
                -ds_name => "cpu"
                , -DST => "GAUGE"
                , -min => 0
                , -max => 100
                ) ;

=back

=head2 add_compute_DS (not yet implemented)

Add a data source with computed primary data points (it is a DS with DST equal to C<COMPUTE>) in the RRD specifications.
Its arguments are :

=over 4

=item B<ds_name> (auxiliary name: B<name>)

(I<mandatory>) The name of the data source.

=item B<rpn_expression>

(I<mandatory>) RPN expression that defines formula to compute PDP of this DS.

=back

=head2 B<add_RRA> (auxiliary name: B<add_archive>)

Add a round robin archive in the RRD specifications.

=over 4

=item B<duration>

(I<mandatory>) The duration of the archive.
Possible values are : "day", "week", "month", "quarter" and "year".

=item B<xff>

(I<optionnal>) The xfiles factor (see <http://www.rrdtool.org>)

    $creator->add_RRA(-duration => "day") ;

=back

=head2 add

Add some global attributes in the RRD specifications.

=over 4

=item B<CF> (auxiliary name: B<cfunc>)

Add a consolidation function (C<AVERAGE>, C<MIN>, C<MAX>, C<LAST>... - see <http://www.rrdtool.org>), 
for each RRA (except the default RRA) in the RRD specifications.

    $creator->add(-CF => "AVERAGE") ;

=back

=head2 B<compile>

Compute the argument for the function C<create> of the underlaying RRDTool::OO object.
Useful for debugging, this function also allows to customize the command passed to rrdtool.
Return this argument (a list). 

    @args = $creator->compile() ;

=head2 B<create>

Create the RRD on the disk.

=over 4

=item B<filename> (auxiliary name: B<file>)

(I<mandatory>) The name of the file to create.

=item B<OO_create_arg>

(I<optionnal>) The argument passed to the function create of the underlaying RRDTool::OO object
(this is the value returned by the previous function C<compile>).
In normal case, this argument isn't provided, and its value is compiled from the current stored data.

    $creator->create(-filename => "/tmp/15s.rrd") ;

which can be break up to :

    @args = $creator->compile() ;
    # possible manual modification on @args here...
    $creator->create(-filename => "/tmp/15s.rrd", -OO_create_arg => \@args) ;

=back

=head1 SUB-OBJECTS

Each sub-objects of C<RRDTool::Creator> creates a RRD with one default archive (RRA) made of primary data points (PDP).
More RAA can then be added.
The constructor neads an argument named C<step> which is the period of acquisition. The time unit of the step depends of the sub-object.

=head2 RRDTool::Creator::HourPDP

The default RRA stores primary data points for an hour.
More RRA can be added for a day, a week, a month, a quarter and a year.
The created RRD is for an acquisition period much less than an hour, typically about some seconds or a few minutes.
So, the step unit for its constructor argument is second(s) or minute(mn).
    
    $creator = new RRDTool::Creator::HourPDP(-step => "30s") ;
    $creator->add_RRA(-duration => "day") ;
    $creator->add_RRA(-duration => "week") ;
    $creator->add_RRA(-duration => "month") ;
    $creator->add_RRA(-duration => "quarter") ;
    $creator->add_RRA(-duration => "year") ;

=head2 RRDTool::Creator::DayPDP

The default RRA stores primary data points for a day.
More RRA can be added for a week, a month, a quarter and a year.
The created RRD is for an acquisition period much less than a day, typically about some minutes or a few hours.
So, the natural step units for its constructor argument are the minute(mn) and hour(h), although second(s) is allowed.
    
    $creator = RRDTool::Creator::DayPDP(-step => "10mn") ;
    $creator->add_RRA(-duration => "week") ;
    $creator->add_RRA(-duration => "month") ;
    $creator->add_RRA(-duration => "quarter") ;
    $creator->add_RRA(-duration => "year") ;

=head2 RRDTool::Creator::WeekPDP

The default RRA stores primary data points for a week.
More RRA can be added for a month, a quarter and a year.
The created RRD is for an acquisition period much less than a week, typically about some hours.
So, the natural step unit for its constructor argument is the hour(h), although second(s), minute(mn) and day(d) are allowed.
    
    $creator = RRDTool::Creator::WeekPDP(-step => "4h") ;
    $creator->add_RRA(-duration => "month") ;
    $creator->add_RRA(-duration => "quarter") ;
    $creator->add_RRA(-duration => "year") ;

=head2 RRDTool::Creator::MonthPDP

The default RRA stores primary data points for a month.
More RRA can be added for a quarter and a year.
The created RRD is for an acquisition period much less than a month, typically about some hours or a few days.
So, the natural step unit for its constructor argument are hour(h) and day(d), although second(s), minute(m) and week(w) are allowed.
    
    $creator = RRDTool::Creator::MonthPDP(-step => "1d") ;
    $creator->add_RRA(-duration => "quarter") ;
    $creator->add_RRA(-duration => "year") ;

=head2 RRDTool::Creator::QuarterPDP

The default RRA stores primary data points for a quarter.
More RRA can be added for a year.
The created RRD is for an acquisition period much less than a quarter, typically about some days or a few weeks.
So, the natural step unit for its constructor argument are day(d) and week(w), although second(s), minute(m), hour(h) and month(m) are allowed.
    
    $creator = RRDTool::Creator::QuarterPDP(-step => "3d") ;
    $creator->add_RRA(-duration => "year") ;

=head2 RRDTool::Creator::YearPDP

The default RRA stores primary data points for a year.
No more RRA can be added.
The created RRD is for an acquisition period much less than a year, typically about some days, a few weeks or months.
So, the natural step unit for its constructor argument are day(d), week(w) and month(m), although second(s), minute(m), hour(h) and quarter(q) are allowed.
    
    $creator = RRDTool::Creator::YearPDP(-step => "1w") ;
