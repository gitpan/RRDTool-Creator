=head1 RRDTool::Creator::QuarterPDP

The default RRA stores primary data points for a month.
More RRA can be added for a quarter and a year.
The created RRD is for an acquisition period much less than a month, typically about some hours or a few days.

=head2 new

This constructor neads an argument named C<step> which is the period of acquisition.
The natural step units are hour(h) and day(d), although second(s), minute(m) and week(w) are allowed.

    $creator = RRDTool::Creator::MonthPDP(-step => "1d") ;
    $creator->add_RRA(-duration => "quarter") ;
    $creator->add_RRA(-duration => "year") ;
